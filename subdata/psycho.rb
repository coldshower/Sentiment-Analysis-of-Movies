00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,650
Our pasta this evening...

2
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,320
is squid ravioli
in a lemon grass broth...

3
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,620
with goat cheese profiteroles,
and I also have an arugula Caesar salad.

4
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,080
For entrees this evening, I have
swordfish meatloaf with onion marmalade,

5
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,500
rare roasted partridge breast in
raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale.

6
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,790
...and grilled free-range rabbit
with herbed french fries.

7
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,670
Our pasta tonight is a squid ravioli
in a lemon grass broth.

8
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,390
God, I hate this place. It's a chick's
restaurant. Why aren't we at Dorsia ?

9
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,470
Because Bateman won't give
the maitre d' head.

10
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,560
Is that Reed Robinson
over there ?

11
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,690
- Are you freebasing or what ?
That's not Robinson. Well, who is it then ?

12
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,730
- It's Paul Allen.
- That's not Paul Allen.

13
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,190
Paul Allen's on the other side
of the room over there.

14
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,280
Who's he with ?
Some weasel from Kicker Peabody.

15
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,200
They don't have a good bathroom
to do coke in.

16
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,160
Are you sure that's Paul Allen over there ?
Yes, McDufus, I am.

17
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,740
- He's handling the Fisher account.
- Lucky bastard.

18
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:59,240
- Lucky Jew bastard.
- Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with anything ?

19
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,250
I've seen that bastard
sitting in his office...

20
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,420
talking on the phone to the C.E.O.s,
spinnin' a fuckin' menorah.

21
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,960
Not a menorah.
You spin a dreidel.

22
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,960
Oh, my God, Bateman.

23
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,050
Do you want me to fry you up some
fucking potato pancakes ? Some latkes ?

24
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,800
No, just... cool it with
the anti-Semitic remarks.

25
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,010
Oh, I forgot. Bateman's dating someone
from the A.C.L.U.

27
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,970
He's the voice of reason.
The boy next door.

28
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,520
Speaking of reasonable--
Only $570.

29
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,560
That's not bad.

30
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,690
A little something
for the purse.

31
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,690
Give her the 50.

32
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,690
Stoli on the rocks.

33
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:17,110
These aren't good anymore.
It's a cash bar.

34
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,480
That'll be $25.

35
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,700
You're a fucking ugly bitch.

36
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,410
I wanna stab you to death...

37
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,030
and play around
with your blood.

38
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,920
What can I get
for you two ?

39
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,780
I live in the
American Gardens building...

40
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,360
on West 81st Street
on the 11th floor.

41
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,570
My name is Patrick Bateman.

42
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,580
I'm 27 years old.

43
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,950
I believe in
taking care of myself,

44
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:25,960
in a balanced diet,
in a rigorous exercise routine.

45
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,420
ln the morning,
if my face is a little pufffy,

46
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,590
I'll put on an icepack
while doing my stomach crunches.

47
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,590
I can do a thousand now.

48
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:55,150
After I remove the icepack,
I use a deeppore cleanser lotion.

49
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,490
In the shower, I use
a water-activated gel cleanser.

50
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,160
Then
a honey-almond bodyscrub.

51
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,990
And on the face,
an exfoliating gelscrub.

52
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,000
Then I apply
an herb mint facialmasque,

53
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:23,090
which lleave on forten minutes
while I prepare the rest of my routine.

54
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,680
I always use an aftershave lotion
with little or no alcohol,

55
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,520
because alcohol dries your face out
and makes you look older.

56
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,560
Then moisturizer,

57
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,600
then an anti-aging eye balm,

58
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:41,190
followed by a final
moisturizing protective lotion.

59
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,860
There is an idea
of a Patrick Bateman.

60
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:50,070
Some kind of abstraction,
but there is no real me.

61
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,080
Only an entity--
something illusory.

62
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,700
And though I can hide
my cold gaze...

63
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,960
and you can shake my hand
and feel flesh gripping yours...

64
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,840
and may be you can even sense
our life styles are probably comparable,

65
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,210
I simply am not there.

66
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,110
Good morning.

67
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,360
Good morning, Hamilton.
Nice tan.

68
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,120
Late.
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages ?

69
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,710
Ricky Harrison has to cancel.
He didn't say what he was cancelling or why.

70
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:51,210
I occasionally box with Ricky
at the Harvard Club. Anyone else ?

71
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:54,550
Spencer wants to meet for drinks
at Fluties, Pier 17. When ?

72
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:57,670
After 6:00.
And what should I say ? Negative. Cancel it.

73
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,590
Just say ‘no’
Just say ‘no’ ?

74
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,390
Okay, Jean.

75
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,970
I need reservations for three
at Camols at 12:30,

76
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,980
and if not there
try Crayons.

77
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,560
Allright ?
Yes, sir.

78
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:16,020
Oh, wait. And I need reservations
for two at Arcadia at 8:00 on Thursday.

79
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,030
Something romantic ?

80
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,190
No.

81
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,740
Silly. Forget it.
I'll make them.

82
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,780
No, I'll do it.
No, no.

83
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:31,040
Be a doll and just get me a mineral
water, okay ? You look nice today.

84
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,710
Don't wear that outfit again.

85
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,750
What ? I didn't hear you.

86
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,460
I said, do not wear
that outfit again.

87
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,550
Wear a dress, a skirt or something.
You don't like this, I take it.

88
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,880
Come on.
You're prettier than that.

89
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,390
- Thanks, Patrick.
- I'm not here.

90
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:53,220
And high heels.
I like high heels.

91
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,020
Feathered friends for 600.

92
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,400
During courtship,
the male frigate bird...

93
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,320
inflates to enormous size
the red pouch found here.

94
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,170
And I want
hundreds of thousands of roses.

95
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,590
And lots of
chocolate truffles,

96
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:29,050
Godiva, and oysters
in the halfshell.

97
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,050
I'm trying to listen to
the new Robert Palmer tape,

98
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:36,550
but Evelyn, my supposed fiance,
keeps buzzing in my ear.

99
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:40,010
Annie Leibovitz.
We'll get Annie Leibovitz.

100
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,390
And we'll have to get
someone to videotape.

101
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,690
Patrick,
we should do it.

102
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,190
Do what ?
Get married. Have a wedding.

103
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,440
No. I can't take
the time off work.

104
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,940
Your father practically owns the company.
You can do anything you like, silly.

105
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,740
- I don't want to talk about it.
- I hate that job anyway.

106
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,740
I don't see why
you just don't quit.

107
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:03,330
Because I want to fit in.

108
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,550
Williams party.

109
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,590
I'm on the verge of tears
by the time we arrive at Espace,

110
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:22,630
since I'm positive
we won't have a decent table.

111
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,220
But we do, and relief washes over me
in an awesome wave.

112
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,560
Patrick, this is my cousin Vanden
and her boyfriend Stash.

113
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,940
They're both artists.
The menu's in braille.

114
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,560
I see you've met everyone.
You look awful.

115
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,900
Okay. Allright.

116
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,030
I'm fairly certain that...

117
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,490
Timothy Bryce and Evelyn
are having an affair.

118
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,410
Timothy is the only
interesting person I know.

119
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,950
I'm almost completely indifferent
as to whether Evelyn knows...

120
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,080
I'm having an affair with Courtney
Rawlinson, her closest friend.

121
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,130
Courtney is almost
perfect looking.

122
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:03,750
She's usually operating on
one or more psychiatric drugs.

123
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,260
Tonight, I believe, it's Xanax.
Mmm. Oh.

124
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,470
More disturbing than her drug use,
though, is the fact that she's engaged...

125
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:13,100
to Luis Carruthers, the biggest doofus
in the business.

126
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,430
Tell me, Stash.

127
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:19,060
Do you think Soho is becoming too...
commercial ?

128
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,440
- Yes. I read that.
- Oh, who gives a rat's ass ?

129
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,480
Hey, that affects us.

130
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,530
Well, what about the massacres in Sri
Lanka, honey ? Doesn't that affect us too ?

131
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,530
Do you know anything about
Sri Lanka ?

132
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,700
How, like, the Sikhs are killing
tons of Israelis over there ?

133
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,780
Come on, Bryce.

134
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,200
There are a lot more important problems
than Sri Lanka to worry about.

135
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,870
- Like what ?
- Well, we have to end apartheid, for one,

136
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:47,290
slow down the nuclear arms race,
stop terrorism and world hunger.

137
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:51,170
We have to provide food and shelter
for the homeless...

138
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,470
and oppose racial discrimination
and promote civil rights,

139
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:58,340
while also promoting
equal rights for women.

140
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,800
We have to encourage
a return...

141
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,510
to traditional moral values.

142
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,980
Most importantly,

143
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:10,350
we have to promote
general social concern...

144
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,320
and less materialism
in young people.

145
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,150
Patrick,
how thought provoking.

146
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,520
Hello.

147
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,310
Hello.

148
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:21,040
Bleaching ? Are you
trying to say ‘bleaching’ ?

149
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,040
Oh, my God.
Two things.

150
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,040
One: You can't bleach a Cerruti.
Out of the question.

151
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,050
Two: I can only get
these sheets in Santa Fe.

152
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,090
These are very expensive sheets,
and I really need them cleaned.

153
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:33,720
Lady, if you don't shut your
fucking mouth, I will kill you.

154
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,350
Now, listen.

155
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,970
I have a lunch meeting at Hubert's
in 20 minutes with Ronald Harrison.

156
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,970
I need those sheets
cleaned by this afternoon.

157
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,390
Listen, I can't understand you !
This is crazy ! You're a fool.

158
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,440
I can't cope with this
stupid ‘bitchee’ !

159
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,020
Understand ?
Christ. Patrick ?

160
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,570
Hi, Patrick.

161
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,780
I thought that was you.
Hello. This is--

162
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,200
Isn't it ridiculous, coming all the way up here ?
They really are the best.

163
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,280
Then why can't they
get these stains out ?

164
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:02,790
I mean, can you talk to these people
or something ? I'm not getting anywhere.

165
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,790
- Oh, what are those ?
- Well, it's--

166
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:09,040
- Cranberry juice. Cranapple.
- Really ?

167
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,880
Listen, if you could talk to them,
I would really appreciate it.

168
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,050
I'm really late. I have a lunch
appointment at Hubert's in 15 minutes.

169
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,420
Hubert's ?
That moved uptown, right ? Oh, boy.

170
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,760
Listen, I've gotta go.
Thank you, Victoria.

171
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,800
Maybe we could do lunch
one day next week.

172
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:25,470
I'm downtown quite often. What about
a Saturday ? I'm at work all the time.

173
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,140
Next Saturday ?
Can't, I'm afraid. Sure.

174
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,390
At a matinee of LesMis.
Listen, I really gotta go.

175
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,270
Oh, Christ.
I'll call you. Okay. Do.

176
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,360
Listen, you're dating Lewis,
he's in Arizona.

177
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,360
You're fucking me,
and we haven't made plans.

178
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,280
What could you possibly
be up to tonight ?

179
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,200
Stop it. I'm--
On a lot of lithium ?

180
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,580
Waiting for Luis to call me.
He said he'd call tonight.

181
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,250
Pumpkin ? Pumpkin,
you're dating an asshole.

182
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:55,120
Mm-hmm. Pumpkin, you're dating the
biggest dickweed in New York.

183
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:59,340
Pumpkin, you're dating
a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.

184
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,510
Patrick, stop calling me
pumpkin, okay ?

185
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:05,970
I have to go.
Courtney ?

186
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,970
Hmm ?
Dinner.

187
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,600
I can't.
I'm thinking Dorsia.

188
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:16,020
Dorsia's nice.
Wear something fabulous.

189
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,100
Oh,yeah !

190
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:30,360
Dorsia.

191
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,620
Um, yes, I know
it's a little late,

192
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:37,330
but is it possible to reserve a
table for two at 8:00 or 8:30, perhaps ?

193
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,970
...a facialat Elizabeth Arden,
which was really relaxing.

194
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:01,270
And then,
to the Pottery Barn,

195
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:04,690
where I got this little...

196
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,150
silver muffin dish.
Is that Donald Trump's car ?

197
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,230
God, Patrick.
Shut up.

198
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,070
You know, Courtney, you should
take some more lithium or have a Diet Coke.

199
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:16,030
Some caffeine might get you
out of this slump.

200
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,820
I just want a child.

201
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,490
Just two...

202
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,120
perfect...

203
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,540
children.

204
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,250
Are we here ?
Yeah.

205
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,220
This is Dorsia ?
Yes, dear.

206
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,010
Courtney, you're gonna have
the peanut butter soup...

207
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,680
with smoked duck
and mashed squash.

208
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:53,650
New York Matinee called it
‘a playful but mysterious little dish.’

209
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:57,560
You'll love it. And then the red
snapper with violets and pine nuts.

210
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,570
I think that'll
follow nicely.

211
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:03,440
Mmm.
Thanks, Patrick.

212
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,490
Patrick, thanks so much
for looking after Courtney.

213
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:15,410
Dorsia.
How impressive.

214
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,710
How on Earth did you get
a reservation there ?

215
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,040
Lucky, I guess.

216
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,090
That's a wonderful suit.

217
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,460
Don't tell me. Don't tell me.
Let me guess.

218
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,550
Mmm, Valentino Couture ?

219
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,720
Uh-huh.
Hmm.

220
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,890
It looks so soft.
Your compliment was sufficient, Luis.

221
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,810
Hello, Halberstram. Nice tie.
How the hell are you ?

222
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:43,190
Allen has mistaken me for this
dickhead, Marcus Halberstram.

223
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,860
It seems logical because
Marcus also works at P&P,

224
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,400
and in fact does
the same exact thing I do.

225
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,450
He also has a penchant for Valentino suits
and Oliver Peoples glasses.

226
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,450
Marcus and I
even go to the same barber,

227
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,740
although I have
a slightly better haircut.

228
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:00,160
- How's the Ransom account going, Marcus ?
- It's, uh, all right.

229
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,580
Really ? That's interesting.
It's not, uh, not great.

230
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,330
- Oh, well, you know.
- So, how's Cecilia ?

231
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,090
- She's a great girl.
- Oh, yeah. I'm very lucky.

232
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,250
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, Allen, congratulations on the Fisher account.

233
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,800
- Thankyou, Baxter.
- Listen, Paul. Squash.

234
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,140
Call me.
How about Friday ?

235
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:26,640
No can do.
I got an 8:30 res at Dorsia.

236
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,190
Greatsea urchin ceviche.

237
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,270
Dorsia on Friday night ?
How'd he swing that ?

238
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,360
I think he's lying.

239
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:40,160
- Is that a gram ?
- New card.

240
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,160
What do you think ?

241
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,830
Whoa-ho.
Very nice.

242
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:49,830
Look at that. Picked them up from
the printer's yesterday.

243
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,830
Good coloring.
That's bone.

244
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,460
And the lettering is something
called Silian Rail.

245
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,000
It's very cool, Bateman,
but that's nothing. Look at this.

246
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:00,460
That is really nice.

247
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:04,470
Eggshell with Romalian type.
What do you think ?

248
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,390
Nice.

249
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:11,970
Jesus. That is really super.
How'da nitwit like you get so tasteful?

250
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,560
I can't believe that Bryce...

251
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,560
prefers Van Patten's card
to mine.

252
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:20,520
But wait.
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

253
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:27,860
Raised lettering,
pale nimbus... white.

254
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,490
Impressive.
Very nice.

255
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,620
Hmm.

256
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,910
Let's see Paul Allen's card.

257
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,340
Look at that subtle
off-white coloring.

258
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,300
The tasteful thickness of it.

259
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:57,600
Oh, my God.
It even has a watermark.

260
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,850
Is something wrong,
Patrick ?

261
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,900
You're sweating.

262
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:38,010
Hello. Pat Bateman.

263
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,090
You want some, uh, money ?

264
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,100
Some food ?

265
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,930
- Is this what you need ?
- I'm-I'm hungry.

266
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,930
Yeah.
Cold out too, isn't it ?

267
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:57,070
Why don't you get a job ?
If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job ?

268
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,110
I lost my job.

269
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,150
Why ? You drinking ?

270
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,950
Is that why you lost it ?
Insider trading ?

271
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,240
Just joking.

272
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,410
Listen, what's your name ?
Al.

273
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,460
Hmm ? Speak up.
Come on. Al.

274
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,750
Get a goddamn job, Al.

275
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,960
You got a negative attitude.
That's what's stopping you.

276
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,590
You gotta get your act together.
I'll help you.

277
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:25,470
You are so kind, mister.
You're a kind-- You're a kind man.

278
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,470
It's okay.
I can tell.

279
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:30,890
Please, you gotta tell me
what to do. You gotta help me.

280
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,930
I'm so cold,
I'm hungry.

281
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,600
You know how bad you smell ?

282
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,770
You reek of shit.
Do you know that ?

283
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:43,190
Al.

284
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:46,280
I'm sorry.
It's just that--

285
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,280
I don't know.

286
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,910
I don't have anything
in common with you.

287
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,790
Oh. Oh, thankyou, mister.
Thankyou.

288
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm cold out here.

289
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,000
You know what a fucking loser you are ?
What ?

290
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:36,320
What beautiful skin you have,
Mr. Bateman.

291
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,610
So fine,
so smooth.

292
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,670
I have all the characteristics
of a human being--

293
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:53,340
flesh, blood, skin, hair--

294
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,670
but not a single, clear,
identifiable emotion,

295
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:00,170
except for greed and disgust.

296
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,890
Something horrible
is happening inside of me,

297
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,890
and I don't know why.

298
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:10,100
My nightly bloodlust
has overflowed into my days.

299
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,900
I feel lethal,
on the verge of frenzy.

300
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,190
I think my mask of sanity
is about to slip.

301
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,490
Hey, Mc Cloy,
what do you say ?

302
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,040
Hey, Hamilton.
Have a holly, jolly Christmas.

303
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,380
Is Allen still handling the Fisher account ?
Ofcourse. Who else ?

304
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,420
Mistletoe alert.
Merry Xmas, Patrick.

305
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,050
Merry Xmas, Harry.
Merry Christmas.

306
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,380
You're late, honey.
Oh, yes, you are. I'm not late.

307
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,550
I've been here the entire time.
You just didn't see me.

308
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,720
Say hello to Snowball.
Snowball says, ‘Merry Christmas, Patrick.’

309
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:58,270
What is it ?
It's a little baby piggly-wiggly, isn't it ?

310
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,770
It's a Vietnamese
potbellied pig.

311
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:03,190
They make darling pets.
Don't you ?

312
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,570
Don't you ?

313
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:08,690
Stop scowling, Patrick.
You're such a grinch.

314
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,990
And what does Mr. Grinch
want for Christmas ?

315
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,320
And don't say
breast implants again.

316
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,910
Allen. Marcus.
Merry Christmas.

317
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:22,080
How you been ? Workaholic, I suppose ?
Haven't seen you in a while.

318
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,250
Hey, Hamilton. We're goin' to Nell's.
Limo's out front.

319
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:29,590
We should have dinner.
Maybe you could bring--

320
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:32,550
Cecilla ?
Yes, Cecilla.

321
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,920
Oh, Cecilla would adore it.

322
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:37,640
Well, then,
let's do it, Marcus.

323
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,720
Great party.
Thanks.

324
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,970
Patrick, why is he
calling you Marcus ?

325
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,680
Mistletoe alert.

326
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,530
Marcus Halberstram
for two at 7:00.

327
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,280
No, l want to know, okay ?
I came here for the cilantro crawfish gumbo,

328
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,950
which is, after all, the only excuse
one could have for being in this restaurant,

329
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:07,450
which is, by the way,
almost completely empty.

330
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:11,000
I'm very sorry, sir.
J&B straight, and a Corona.

331
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,790
Would you like to hear--
Double Absolut martini.

332
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,920
Yes, sir.
Would you like to hear the specials ?

333
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,420
Not if you want
to keep your spleen.

334
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,510
This is a real beehive of activity, Halberstram.
This place is hot.

335
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:29,470
Very hot.
Listen, the mud soup and charcoal arugula...

336
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,470
are outrageous here.

337
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,850
Yeah, well, you're late.
Hey, I'm a child ofdivorce.

338
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:36,480
Give me a break.

339
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:41,820
I see they've omitted the pork loin
with lime Jell-O. We should've gone to Dorsia.

340
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,570
I could've gotten us a table.
Nobody goes there anymore.

341
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,320
Is that Ivana Trump ?

342
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,290
Oh, geez, Patrick. I mean, Marcus.
What are you thinking ?

343
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:57,120
Why would Ivana
be at Texarkana ?

344
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:01,210
So, uh, wasn't Rothchild originally
handling the Fisher account ?

345
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:05,880
How'd you get it ?
Well, I could tell you that, Halberstram,

346
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,300
but then I'd have to
kill you.

347
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:18,850
I like to dissect girls.
Did you know I'm utterly insane ?

348
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:24,150
Great tan, Marcus.
I mean, really impressive.

349
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,020
Where do you tan ?
Salon.

350
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,360
I've got a tanning bed at home.
You should look into it.

351
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,690
And, uh, Cecilla.

352
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,070
How is she ?
Where is she tonight ?

353
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:37,070
Cecilla's, uh--
Well, you know Cecilla.

354
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,830
I think she's having dinner
with, um, Evelyn Williams.

355
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:42,750
Evelyn ?
Great ass.

356
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:46,500
Goes out with that loser
Patrick Bateman. What a dork.

357
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,710
Another martini, Paul ?

358
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,420
You like
Huey Lewis and the News ?

359
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,680
Um, they're okay.

360
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,470
They're early work was a little
too new wave for my taste.

361
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,520
But when Sports
came out in '83,

362
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,600
I think they really came into their own,
commercially and artistically.

363
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,570
The whole album has
a clear, crisp sound,

364
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:20,320
and a new sheen of
consummate professionalism...

365
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,610
that really gives the songs
a big boost.

366
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:35,330
He's been compared
to Elvis Costello,

367
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:40,090
but I think Huey has a far more bitter,
cynical sense of humor.

368
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:42,090
Hey, Halberstram ?
Yes, Allen ?

369
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:45,050
Why are there copies of the Style
section all over the place ?

370
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:49,970
Do you-- Do you have a dog ?
A little chow or something ?

371
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:52,930
- No, Allen.
- Is that a raincoat ?

372
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:55,270
Yes, it is.

373
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,900
In '87, Huey released this--

374
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,900
Fore, their most
accomplished album.

375
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:03,650
I think their undisputed
masterpiece is ‘Hip To Be Square.’

376
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:06,490
The song's so catchy, most people
probably don't listen to the lyrics.

377
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:09,030
But they should,
because it's not just about...

378
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,990
the pleasures of conformity
and the importance of trends.

379
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:16,290
It's also a personal statement
about the band itself. Hey, Paul !

380
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:24,830
Try getting a reservation
at Dorsia now,

381
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,000
you fuckin' stupid bastard !

382
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:32,050
You fucking bastard !

383
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:34,900
He was completely naked
and standing up on the table.

384
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,440
He had no clothes on
what so ever, and he--

385
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,440
Patrick ?
Patrick.

386
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:42,110
Is that you ?

387
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,450
No, Luis, it's not me.
You're mistaken.

388
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,620
This is my very good friend,
Patrick Bateman.

389
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,870
Where are you going ? We're going to Nell's.
Gwendolyn's father is buying it.

390
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:54,710
Ooh.

391
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,170
Where did you get
that overnight bag ?

392
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,630
Jean-Paul Gaultier.

393
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:15,810
When I get
to Paul Allen's place,

394
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,850
I use the keys
I took from his pocket...

395
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,940
before disposing
of the body.

396
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:23,150
There is a moment
of sheer panic...

397
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:27,610
when I realize that Paul's
apartment overlooks the park...

398
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:30,360
and is obviously
more expensive than mine.

399
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,330
I calm myself
and move into the bedroom,

400
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:39,580
where I find his suitcase
and start to pack.

401
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,460
It's time for Paul
to take a little trip.

402
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,590
Where do I send the bastard ?

403
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,630
Dallas ?

404
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:52,210
Paris ? Singapore ?

405
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,430
London ? I'll send
the asshole to London.

406
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:03,930
Hi. This is Paul.

407
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:06,100
I've been called away
to London for a few days.

408
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:09,440
Meredith, I'll call you when I get back.
Hasta la vista, baby.

409
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,960
What is it ?

410
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,710
Patrick.
Yes, Jean ?

411
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,970
There's a Mr. Donald Kimball
here to see you. Who ?

412
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:46,640
Detective Donald Kimball.

413
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,720
Tell him I'm at lunch.

414
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:56,270
Patrick, it's only 10:30.
I think he knows you're here.

415
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,690
Send him in, I guess.

416
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,570
Now, John, you've gotta wear clothes
in proportion to your physique.

417
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:13,490
There are definite do's and don'ts, good buddy,
of wearing a bold-striped shirt.

418
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,910
A bold-striped shirt
calls for solid-colored...

419
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,420
or discreetly patterned
suits and ties.

420
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,920
Yes, always tip the stylist
15 percent.

421
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,800
Listen,John, I've gotta go.
T. Boone Pickens just walked in.

422
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,550
Just joking. No, don't tip
the owner of the salon.

423
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:32,550
Okay, John ? Right.

424
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,850
Got it.
Sorry about that.

425
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,520
No, I'm sorry.
I should've made an appointment.

426
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,520
Was that anything important ?

427
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,650
Oh, that ?
Just mulling over business problems,

428
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:48,110
examining opportunities, exchanging rumors,
spreading gossip.

429
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:51,360
Hi.

430
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,400
I'm Donald Kimball.
Hi. Pat Bateman.

431
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,700
Nice to meet you. Sorry to barge
in on you like this.

432
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,780
I know how busy
you guys can get.

433
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,540
So, what's the, uh,
topic of discussion ?

434
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:08,080
I've been hired
by Meredith Powell...

435
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:11,210
to investigate the disappearance
of Paul Allen.

436
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:15,550
I see, yeah.
Paul's disappearance, yeah.

437
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,720
So it's nothing
that official.

438
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,970
- I just have some questions about
Paul Allen and yourself. - Coffee ?

439
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:23,180
- No, I'm okay.
- Apollinaris ?

440
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,180
No, I'm okay.

441
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,810
Can you bring Mr.--

442
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:30,560
Kimball. No, I'm okay.
Mr. Kimball a bottle of Apollinaris.

443
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,730
It's no problem.

444
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,530
So, what's the topic
of discussion ?

445
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:40,320
The disappearance
of Paul Allen.

446
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,030
Uh-huh, right.
Well, I, um, haven't--

447
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:48,740
I haven't heard anything about
the disappearance or anything.

448
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:51,000
Not on page six, at least.

449
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,750
- I think his family wants this kept quiet.
- Understandable. Lime ?

450
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:58,840
- No, really, I'm okay.
- You sure ? I can always get you a lime.

451
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,920
Just some preliminary questions that I need
for my own files, okay ?

452
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,970
Shoot.

453
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:06,510
Hold old are you ?
Twenty-seven.

454
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,510
Where did you go to school ?
Harvard.

455
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:11,220
Then Harvard Business School.
Your address ?

456
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,520
The American Gardens Building,
West 81st Street.

457
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,100
- Nice. Very nice.
- Thanks.

458
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:20,900
What can you tell me about Paul Allen ?
I'm at a loss.

459
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:23,860
He was part of that whole Yale thing.
‘Yale thing’ ?

460
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,780
- Yeah, Yale thing.
- What do you mean, ‘Yale thing’ ?

461
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:30,780
Well, I think for one that he was probably
a closet homosexual...

462
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,820
who did a lot of cocaine.

463
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,950
That ‘Yale thing.’

464
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:39,250
What kind of man was he, besides
the information you've just given ?

465
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:42,120
- I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
- You feel like that ?

466
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:44,290
No, not really.

467
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,210
Where did Paul hang out ?

468
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,210
Hang out ?
Yeah, you know, hang out.

469
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:54,470
Let me think.
Um, the Newport, Harry's,

470
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,510
Fluties, Indochine,

471
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,510
Nell's, the Cornell Club,

472
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,970
the New York Yacht Club.
He had a yacht ?

473
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:04,980
- No, he just hung out there.
- And where did he go to school ?

474
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,560
Don't you know this ?

475
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,610
I just wanted to know
if you know.

476
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:16,780
Before Yale, if I remember correctly,
St. Paul's.

477
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,820
Listen, I just--
I just wanna help.

478
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:22,910
I understand.

479
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,330
Do you have any witnesses
or fingerprints ?

480
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:31,500
Well, there's a message on his answering
machine that says he went to London.

481
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:34,130
- Well, maybe he did, huh ?
- His girlfriend doesn't think so.

482
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:36,340
- But has anyone seen him in London ?
- Actually, yes.

483
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,670
Hmm. But I've had a hardtime
getting actual verification.

484
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,600
A Stephen Hughes said he saw him
at a restaurant there.

485
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,600
But I checked it out,
and what happened is...

486
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,020
he mistook a Herbert Ainsworth
for Paul, so--

487
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,350
- Had his apartment been burglarized ?
- No, actually, it hadn't.

488
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,980
Toiletries were missing, a suit was
gone, so was some luggage. That's it.

489
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,480
I mean, no one's dealing with the
homicide squad yet or anything, right ?

490
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:00,030
No, not yet.
As I said, we're not sure.

491
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:02,450
Basically, no one's seen
or heard anything.

492
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:05,320
So typical, isn't it ?
It's just strange.

493
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:07,910
One day,
someone's walking around,

494
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:10,490
going to work, alive,
and then--

495
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:13,000
Nothing.

496
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,040
People just disappear.

497
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,790
The earth just...
opens up and swallows them.

498
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:23,170
Eerie.
Really eerie.

499
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,970
Listen, you'll have
to excuse me.

500
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:35,310
I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable
at Four Seasons in 20 minutes.

501
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:39,350
The Four Seasons ?
Isn't that a little far uptown ?

502
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,810
I mean, aren't you gonna be late ?
No, there's one down here.

503
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,360
Oh, really ? I didn't know that.
Yeah, it's very good.

504
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,570
Listen, if anything else
occurs to you, any information--

505
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:52,320
Absolutely. I'm 100 percent with you.
Great.

506
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:56,030
And thanks for your time,
Mr. Bateman.

507
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,910
Bye-bye.
Good-bye.

508
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:04,640
I haven't seen you around here.
You just haven't been lookin'.

509
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:09,100
- Would you like to see my apartment ?
- I'm not supposed to.

510
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:12,730
Do you wanna come
to my apartment or not ?

511
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:19,320
I'm not supposed to,
but I can make an exception.

512
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,980
Do you take a credit card ?

513
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:25,650
I'm joking.

514
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,700
Come on. Get in.

515
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:40,290
I'd like a girl.
Early 20s.

516
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,800
Blonde, who does couples.
Couples.

517
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:48,260
And I really can't stress
blonde enough. Blonde.

518
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,010
I'm Paul.

519
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:56,310
My name's Paul Allen.
You got that ?

520
00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:00,310
You're Christie.
You're to respond only to Christie.

521
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:02,310
Is that clear ?

522
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,360
That's a very fine chardonnay
you're drinking.

523
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:17,200
I want you
to clean your vagina.

524
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:29,380
No. From behind.
Get on your knees.

525
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:32,250
You have a very nice body.

526
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,850
Mm-hmm ?

527
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:47,600
Thank you. Send her up.

528
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:53,400
Christie,
get out and dry off.

529
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,360
Choose a robe--
not the Bijan--

530
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,900
and come and meet me and our guest in
the living room for drinks.

531
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,830
You've arrived.
How lovely.

532
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:11,830
Let me take your coat.

533
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,670
I'm Paul.
How good of you to come.

534
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,420
Not quite blonde,
are you ?

535
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,420
More dirty blonde.

536
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:25,970
I'm gonna call you
Sabrina.

537
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:28,140
I'm Paul Allen.

538
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:49,450
So.

539
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,450
Don't you wanna know
what I do ?

540
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:58,410
No.
No, not really.

541
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:03,170
Well, I work on Wall Street...

542
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,500
for Pierce & Pierce.

543
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,670
Have you heard of it ?

544
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,560
You have a really
nice place here, Paul.

545
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,600
How much
did you pay for it ?

546
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,730
Well, actually,

547
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:26,650
that's none of your business,
Christie.

548
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:30,480
But I can assure you,
it certainly wasn't cheap.

549
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,820
No. No smoking.
Not in here.

550
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:37,360
Varda truffle ?

551
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:42,160
I don't want you to get drunk,

552
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,580
but that's a very fine
chardonnay you're not drinking.

553
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,670
Do you like Phil Collins ?

554
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,970
I've been a big Genesis fan
eversince the release...

555
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:02,050
of their 1980 album Duke.

556
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:06,850
Before that, I really didn't
understand any of their work.

557
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:09,980
It was too artsy,
too intellectual.

558
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,770
It was on Duke where...

559
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:15,770
Phil Collins' presence
became more apparent.

560
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,360
I think Invisible Touch is the group's
undisputed masterpiece.

561
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,870
It's an epic meditation
on intangibility.

562
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:35,620
At the same time,
it deepens and enriches...

563
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:39,090
the meaning of
the preceding three albums.

564
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:42,170
Christie,
take off the robe.

565
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:46,300
Listen to the brilliant
ensemble playing...

566
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:49,010
of Banks, Collins
and Rutherford.

567
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:53,430
You can practically hear
every nuance of every instrument.

568
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:55,430
Sabrina, remove your dress.

569
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:00,600
ln terms of lyrical craftsmanship
and sheer songwriting,

570
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:03,690
this album hits a new peak
of professionalism.

571
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:06,190
Sabrina, why don't you,
uh, dance a little.

572
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:10,200
Take the lyrics to
‘Land of Confusion.’

573
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,410
In this song,
Phil Collins...

574
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:16,540
addresses the problems
of abusive political authority.

575
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:22,330
‘In Too Deep’ is the most moving pop song
of the 1980s...

576
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:25,710
about monogamy and commitment.

577
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:29,090
The song is
extremely uplifting.

578
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:32,550
Their lyrics are
as positive and affirmative...

579
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:36,890
as, uh, anything
I've heard in rock.

580
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:42,560
Christie,
get down on your knees...

581
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,690
so Sabrina can see your asshole.

582
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:48,440
Phil Collins' solo career...

583
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,360
seems to be more commercial,

584
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,570
and therefore more satisfying
in a narrower way,

585
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:59,200
especially songs like ‘In the
Air Tonight’ and ‘Against All Odds.’

586
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,120
Sabrina, don't just stare at it.
Eat it.

587
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:08,160
I also think that
Phil Collins works best...

588
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:12,210
within the confines of the group
than as a solo artist.

589
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:15,670
And I stress the word ‘artist.’

590
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:21,590
This is ‘Sussudio.’

591
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,680
A great, great song.
A personal favorite.

592
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:41,190
Look at the camera.

593
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:19,180
Christie, look at the camera.

594
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:36,370
Don't touch the watch.

595
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:00,510
Can we go now ?

596
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:02,510
We're not through yet.

597
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:23,910
If they have a good personality and they
are not great looking, then who fucking cares ?

598
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:25,910
Let's just say
hypothetically, okay ?

599
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:28,240
What if they have
a good personality ?

600
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:31,410
I know.
I know.

601
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,080
There are no girls
with good personalities.

602
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:37,000
A good personality consists
of a chick with a little hard body...

603
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:39,000
who will satisfy
all sexual demands...

604
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:41,010
without being too slutty
about things...

605
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:43,010
and who will essentially keep
her dumb fucking mouth shut.

606
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:45,050
The only girls
with good personalities...

607
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:48,350
who are smart or maybe funny
or halfway intelligent or talented--

608
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:51,260
though God knows what the fuck that means--
are ugly chicks.

609
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,640
Absolutely. And this is because
they have to make up...

610
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:55,520
for how fucking
unattractive they are.

611
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,810
- Do you know what Ed Gein said about women ?
- Maitre d' at Canal Bar ?

612
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:02,860
- No, serial killer, Wisconsin, in the 50s.
- And what did Ed say ?

613
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:06,030
‘When I see a pretty girl walking
down the street, I think two things.

614
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:08,530
‘One part of me wants to
take her out and talk to her,

615
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:11,070
be real nice and sweet
and treat her right.’

616
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,580
- And what did the other part
of him think ?

617
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:16,240
What her head would look like
on a stick.

618
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,340
Hi, guys.
I wanna get your opinion on something.

619
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:28,090
It's my business card.

620
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:31,550
I decided to get
a new one too.

621
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:35,010
Oh, it's--

622
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:37,010
Very nice, Luis.

623
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,470
Thank you.

624
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,450
Listen, what about dinner ?

625
00:47:56,490 --> 00:47:59,320
Is that all you ever have to contribute,
Van Patten ? ‘What about fucking dinner’ ?

626
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:02,450
Cheer up there, Bateman. What's the matter ?
No shiatsu this morning ?

627
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:05,790
Keep touching me like that, you'll draw
back a stump. Hold on there, little buddy.

628
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:07,790
Excuse me.

629
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:48,120
God. Patrick.
Why here ?

630
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,830
I've seen you
looking at me.

631
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:54,120
I've noticed your...

632
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:56,830
hot body.

633
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,920
Don't be shy.

634
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,170
You can't imagine how long
I've wanted this--

635
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:03,880
ever since that Christmas party
at Arizona 206.

636
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,220
You know, the one you were wearing
that red-striped paisley Armani tie.

637
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:14,680
I want you.
I want you too.

638
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,680
Patrick.
What is it ?

639
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:19,850
Where are you going ?

640
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,730
I've gotta return
some video tapes.

641
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,280
Patrick !

642
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:58,760
Okay, London the--

643
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:01,680
London, there's, um, a reservation--
Any Paul Allen ?

644
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:04,140
No. A reservation, but--
Kimball !

645
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:06,350
I've been wanting to talk with you.
Come into my office.

646
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,350
Jean, greatjacket.
Matsuta ?

647
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:12,400
Do you remember where you were the night
of Paul's disappearance,

648
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,400
which was on
the 20th of December ?

649
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,490
God.

650
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:19,660
I guess I was probably
returning video tapes.

651
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,080
I had a date
with a girl named Veronica.

652
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,620
That's not what I've got.
What ?

653
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:30,080
That's not the information
I've received.

654
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,460
Well, I-- Wait.

655
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,500
- What information have you received ?
- Let me see.

656
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:38,420
Well--

657
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:40,420
You were with--
Well, I could be wrong.

658
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:44,090
When was the last time
you were with Paul Allen ?

659
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:46,430
We'd gone to a new musical...

660
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:50,060
called
Oh, Africa, Brave Africa.

661
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:53,230
It was a laugh riot.
That was about it.

662
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:56,690
I think we had dinner at Orso's. No, Peto--
No, Orso's.

663
00:50:56,770 --> 00:51:00,030
I hope I've been informative.
Long day, a bit scattered.

664
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:02,070
I'm a little spent now too.

665
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:05,280
But how about lunch
in a week or so...

666
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,610
when I've sorted out
all this information ?

667
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:09,620
Great.
Yes, I'd like that.

668
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:12,910
And if you could try and pin down
where you were...

669
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:16,620
the night of Paul Allen's disappearance,
it would make my job a lot easier.

670
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,960
Absolutely.
I'm with you on that one.

671
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:24,500
Huey Lewis and the News.

672
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:30,470
Great stuff. I just bought it on my way here.
You heard it ?

673
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:35,560
Never. I mean,
I don't really like singers.

674
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:39,140
Not a big music fan, huh ?
No, I like music.

675
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:43,900
Just they're--
Huey's too black sounding for me.

676
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:46,020
To each his own.

677
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:50,320
So, lunch next week ?

678
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,320
I'll be there.

679
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:03,410
Oh !

680
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,500
Oh !

681
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:31,560
Will you call me before Easter ?
Maybe.

682
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:37,190
What are you doing tonight ?

683
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,070
Dinner at, uh, River Cafe.

684
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:43,450
Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
That's nice.

685
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:48,200
I never knew you smoked.

686
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:50,210
You never noticed.

687
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,750
Listen, Patrick.

688
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,670
Can we talk ?

689
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,090
You look... marvelous.

690
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,060
There's nothing to say.

691
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:13,680
You're gonna marry Luis.
Isn't that special ?

692
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:17,150
Patrick ?

693
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:23,610
Yes, Courtney ?

694
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,950
If I don't see you
before Easter,

695
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:31,120
have a nice one, okay ?

696
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,080
You too.

697
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:46,380
Patrick ?

698
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,380
Yeah ?

699
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:54,300
Nothing.

700
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:22,330
There is this theory now--
Listen to me.

701
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:24,330
There is this theory now that if
you can catch the AlDS virus...

702
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:27,830
by having sex with someone who's infected,
then you can catch anything.

703
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:31,210
Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy,
hemophilia,

704
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:34,000
leukemia, diabetes,
dyslexia.

705
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:36,800
I'm not sure, but I don't think
dyslexia is a virus.

706
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,260
But who knows ?
They don't know that.

707
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:41,260
Prove it.

708
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:54,770
Oh, God.
What ?

709
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:58,280
It's a fucking milligram of sweetener.
I wanna get high off this,

710
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,650
not sprinkle it on my fucking oatmeal.
It's definitely weak,

711
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:02,860
but I have a feeling if we do
enough of it, we'll be okay.

712
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:06,410
Can you keep it down ?
I'm trying to do drugs.

713
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:08,830
Fuck you ! Calm down.
Let's do it anyway.

714
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:10,870
That's right.

715
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:12,910
That is if the faggot in the next
stall thinks it's okay !

716
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,920
Fuck you !
Hey, fuck you !

717
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:19,750
Sorry, dude. Steroids.

718
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,210
Okay, let's do it.

719
00:55:42,110 --> 00:55:44,900
Where did Craig go ?

720
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:48,400
Well, Gorbachev is downstairs.
McDermott went to sign a peace treaty...

721
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:50,410
between the United States
and Russia.

722
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:53,240
He's the one behind Glasnost.

723
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56,790
- He said he was in mergers and acquisitions.
- You're not confused, are you ?

724
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:58,910
No, not really.

725
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,830
Gorbachev is not downstairs.
- Karen's right.

726
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:04,580
Gorbachev's not downstairs.
He's at Tunnel.

727
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:06,590
Ask me a question.

728
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,920
So, what do you do ?

729
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,430
I'm into, uh, well, murders
and executions, mostly.

730
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:17,350
- Do you like it ?
- Well, it depends. Why ?

731
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:22,680
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers
and acquisitions really don't like it.

732
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:28,690
So, where do you work out ?

733
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,900
You think I'm dumb,
don't you ?

734
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:37,070
What ? You think I'm dumb.
You think all models are dumb.

735
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:39,990
No.
I really don't.

736
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:42,830
That's okay.
I don't mind.

737
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:44,830
There's something sweet
about you.

738
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:13,270
Doin' the crossword ?

739
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,570
You need any help ?

740
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:33,450
-Jean ?
- Yes, Patrick ?

741
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:36,830
Would you like to accompany me
to dinner ?

742
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:39,790
That is,
if you're not doing anything.

743
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:42,630
Um, no. No,
I don't have any plans.

744
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,840
Well,

745
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:51,090
isn't this a coincidence ?

746
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:53,470
Listen, where should we go ?
Anywhere you want.

747
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:56,520
Let's not think about what I want.
How about anywhere you want ?

748
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,100
I don't know, Patrick.
I can't make this decision.

749
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:04,900
Come on.
Where do you wanna go ?

750
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:09,820
Anywhere you want, just say it.
I can get us in anywhere.

751
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,820
What about...

752
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:21,910
Dorsia ?

753
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:30,670
So,

754
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:33,260
Dorsia is where
Jean wants to go.

755
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:36,970
Well, I don't know.
We'll go wherever you wanna go.

756
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:38,970
Dorsia is fine.

757
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:47,270
Dorsia. Yes ?

758
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:51,520
Yeah, can you take two tonight at,
oh, let's say 9:00 ? We're totally booked.

759
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,520
Really ? That's great.

760
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:57,110
No, I said we are totally booked.
Two at 9:00 ? Perfect.

761
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:59,200
See ya then.

762
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:04,240
Yeah ?

763
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:07,750
You're... dressed okay.

764
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:12,040
- You didn't give a name.
- They know me.

765
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:16,840
Why don't you meet me
at my place at 7:00...

766
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,300
for drinks.

767
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:21,300
And Jean,

768
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:23,380
you'll wanna change
before we go out.

769
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:33,890
Patrick, it's so elegant.

770
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:35,980
What a wonderful view.

771
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:38,480
Jean,

772
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,480
sorbet ?

773
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:44,400
Thanks, Patrick.
I'd love some.

774
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:54,240
Do you want a bite ?
I'm on a diet. But thank you.

775
00:59:54,330 --> 00:59:57,790
You don't need to lose any weight.
You're kidding, right ?

776
00:59:57,870 --> 00:59:59,920
You look great.
Very fit.

777
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:04,340
You can always be thinner,
look better.

778
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:08,880
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner.
I don't wanna ruin your will power.

779
01:00:08,970 --> 01:00:11,720
No, it's all right.

780
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:15,220
I'm not very good
at controlling it anyway.

781
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:19,810
So listen.

782
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:22,940
What do you really
wanna do with your life ?

783
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:25,270
Just briefly, summarize.

784
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:28,190
And don't tell me you enjoy working
with children, okay ?

785
01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:32,650
Well, I'd like to travel
and maybe go back to school,

786
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:35,660
but I don't really know.

787
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:40,120
I'm at a point in my life where
there seems to be so many possibilities,

788
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:43,700
but I'm-- I don't know--
I'm just so unsure.

789
01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:49,880
Do you have a boyfriend ?

790
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:53,710
No, not really.
Interesting.

791
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:57,420
Are you seeing anyone ?
I mean, seriously ?

792
01:00:57,510 --> 01:00:59,840
Maybe.

793
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:03,060
I don't know.
Not really.

794
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:08,100
Jean,

795
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:10,850
do you feel... fulfilled ?

796
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:13,560
I mean, in your life ?

797
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:16,610
I guess I do. For a long time
I was too focused on my work.

798
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:21,780
But now I've really begun to think
about changing myself, you know,

799
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:24,370
developing and growing.

800
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:27,660
Growing.
I'm glad you said that.

801
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:34,330
Did you know that, uh,
Ted Bundy's first dog,

802
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:37,580
a collie,
was named Lassie ?

803
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:41,090
Had you heard this ?
Who's Ted Bundy ?

804
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:45,380
Forget it.

805
01:01:45,470 --> 01:01:48,090
What's that ?

806
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:53,140
Duct tape. I need it for, uh,
taping something.

807
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,900
Patrick,

808
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:03,770
have you ever wanted to...
make someone happy ?

809
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:06,240
What ? No !
Put it in the carton.

810
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:10,950
Sorry.

811
01:02:10,990 --> 01:02:12,740
Jean ?

812
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:19,290
What ?
Uh, make someone happy ?

813
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:23,000
Have you ever wanted to ?

814
01:02:25,330 --> 01:02:27,840
I'm looking for, uh,

815
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:34,930
I guess you could say I just wanna have
a meaningful relationship...

816
01:02:35,010 --> 01:02:38,850
with someone special.
Hmm.

817
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,860
Patrick ? Patrick ?
I know you're there.

818
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:52,150
Pick up the phone,
you badboy.

819
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:56,320
What are you up to tonight ?
It's me. Don't try to hide.

820
01:02:56,360 --> 01:03:00,570
I hope you're not with some little number
you picked up because you're my Mr. Bateman.

821
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:03,290
My boy next door.

822
01:03:03,370 --> 01:03:05,790
Anyway, you never called me
and you said you would,

823
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:08,370
and I'll leave a message for Jean
about this, too, to remind you,

824
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:10,830
but we're having dinner
with Melania and Taylor.

825
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,170
You know Me lania.
She went to Sweet Briar.

826
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:15,500
And we're meeting
at the Cornell Club,

827
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:17,550
so I'll call you
tomorrowmorning, honey.

828
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:20,010
Oops. Sorry.
I know you hate that.

829
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:25,550
Bye, Patrick.
Bye, Mr. Big Time C.E.O. Bye-bye.

830
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:31,850
Was that Evelyn ?

831
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:37,150
Are you still seeing her?

832
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,530
I'm sorry.
I have no right to ask that.

833
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:51,870
Do you want me to go ?

834
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:53,870
Yeah.

835
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:58,670
I don't think
I can control myself.

836
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:05,670
I know. I should go. I know I have
a tendency to get involved with unavailable men.

837
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:10,140
I mean,

838
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:14,140
do you want me to go ?

839
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:17,180
I think if you stay,

840
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:19,940
something bad will happen.

841
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:23,190
I think I might hurt you.

842
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:27,030
You don't wanna get hurt,
do you ?

843
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:29,400
No. No, I guess not.

844
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:33,410
I don't wanna get bruised.

845
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,290
You're right.
I should go.

846
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:48,880
Oh. Don't forget you have a lunch date
tomorrow with Donald Kimball at Smith and Wolenski's.

847
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,300
Thanks.

848
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:54,670
It slipped my mind completely.

849
01:05:13,730 --> 01:05:17,740
So, the night
he disappeared--

850
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:20,570
any new thoughts
about what you did ?

851
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:25,990
Not sure.
Um, I had a shower...

852
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:28,000
and some sorbet ?

853
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:30,120
I think you're getting
your dates mixed up.

854
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:32,120
But how ?

855
01:05:32,210 --> 01:05:35,250
Where do you place...
Paul that night ?

856
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:38,840
According to his date book, and
this was verified by his secretary,

857
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:41,840
he had dinner
with Marcus Halberstram.

858
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:44,130
And ?
I questioned him.

859
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:48,470
- Marcus ? - Yes, and he denies it, though,
at first, he couldn't be sure.

860
01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:51,470
But he denied it.
Yes.

861
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:54,770
Well, does Marcus
have an alibi ?

862
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:58,310
Yes.
He does ? You'resure ?

863
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,320
I checked it out.
It's clean.

864
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:07,860
Now, where were you ?

865
01:06:07,950 --> 01:06:10,030
Where was Marcus ?

866
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:12,280
He wasn't with Paul Allen.

867
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:14,500
Who was he with ?
He was...

868
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:17,040
at Atlantis... with...

869
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:21,170
Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble,
Harry Newman, George Butner...

870
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:23,790
and... you.

871
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:29,930
Oh, right, yeah.
Of course.

872
01:06:30,010 --> 01:06:34,180
We had wanted
Paul Allen to come,

873
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:36,430
but he had made plans.

874
01:06:36,510 --> 01:06:40,480
And I guess I had dinner with
Victoria the following night.

875
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:42,940
Personally, I think the guy
went a little nutso.

876
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:47,900
Split town for a while. Maybe he did go
to London, sightseeing, drinking, whatever.

877
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:52,190
Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn
up sooner or later. I mean, to think...

878
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:57,530
that one of his friends killed him for no
reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous.

879
01:06:57,570 --> 01:06:59,870
Isn't that right, Patrick ?

880
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:23,180
Christie. Christie.

881
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:27,020
I'm not so sure about this.
I had to go to Emergency after last time.

882
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:29,850
This won't be anything
like last time. I promise.

883
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:32,730
I don't think so.

884
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:36,070
Just come in the limo
and talk to me for a minute.

885
01:07:36,110 --> 01:07:38,070
The driver's here.
You'll be safe.

886
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,300
Nothing like last time.
Promise.

887
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:01,300
All right.

888
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:04,670
So, you're looking great.
How have you been ?

889
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:08,600
Well, I actually might need surgery
after last time. Really ?

890
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:12,770
My friend told me I should maybe
even get a lawyer.

891
01:08:12,810 --> 01:08:15,520
Lawyers are so complicated.

892
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:18,140
Don't do that.

893
01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:20,150
Here's a check.

894
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:11,730
Uh-uh. Half now,
half later.

895
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:20,490
Okay, your name is Christie.

896
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:23,200
We're meeting a friend
of mine, Elizabeth.

897
01:09:23,290 --> 01:09:27,710
She'll bejoining us
in my new apartment shortly.

898
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:31,210
You'll like her.
She's a very nice girl.

899
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:40,930
You look really familiar.
Did you go to Dalton ?

900
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:46,060
I think I met you at Surf Bar, didn't I ?
With Spicey ?

901
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:49,350
Well, maybe not with Spicey, but
definitely at SurfBar. You know, SurfBar.

902
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:51,560
Anyway, Surf Bar sucks now.
It's terrible.

903
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:56,810
Went to a birthday party there
for Malcolm Forbes. Oh, my God, please.

904
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:59,440
This is nicer
than your other apartment.

905
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:03,740
Oh, it's not
that nice.

906
01:10:08,410 --> 01:10:12,080
Where did you two meet ?
Oh, God. We met at...

907
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:16,580
oh, God, at the Kentucky Derby
in '85, or '86.

908
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:19,960
You were hanging out with that
bimbo Allison Poole. Hot number.

909
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:22,300
What do you mean ?
She was a hot number.

910
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:26,970
If you had a platinum card, she'd give you
a blowjob. This girl worked in a tanning salon.

911
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:29,590
What do you do ?

912
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:33,600
She's my... cousin.

913
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:37,600
Uh-huh.
She's from... France.

914
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:41,020
Where's your phone ?
I've gotta call Harley.

915
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:48,190
Where do you summer,
South Hampton ?

916
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:52,530
- No.
- Oh, God, it's his machine.

917
01:10:52,610 --> 01:10:56,620
It's 3:00 in the morning. He's a goddamn
drug dealer. These are his peak hours.

918
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:58,790
Don't tell him you're here.
Why would I ?

919
01:10:58,870 --> 01:11:00,790
This tastes weird.

920
01:11:00,870 --> 01:11:05,120
Harley, it's me. I need your services.
Translate that howeveryou want.

921
01:11:05,210 --> 01:11:08,960
- I'm at--
- Paul Allen's.

922
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:11,340
Who ?
Paul Allen's.

923
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:15,340
I want the number, idiot. Anyway, I'm at
Paul Norman's and I'll try you again later.

924
01:11:15,430 --> 01:11:19,180
And if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow
night I'm gonna sic my hairdresser on you.

925
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:21,180
Did you know that guy
who disappeared ?

926
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:24,140
Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce ?
Was he a friend of yours ?

927
01:11:24,230 --> 01:11:26,140
No.

928
01:11:26,230 --> 01:11:29,100
Do you have any coke ?
Or Halcyon ?

929
01:11:29,150 --> 01:11:32,190
I would take a Halcyon.
Listen.

930
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:36,030
I would just like to see...

931
01:11:36,110 --> 01:11:38,610
the two of you...
get it on.

932
01:11:38,650 --> 01:11:41,870
What's wrong with that ?

933
01:11:41,950 --> 01:11:44,200
It's totally disease free.

934
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:49,120
Patrick, you're a lunatic.
Come on.

935
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:51,500
Don't you find Christie
attractive ?

936
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:55,340
Let's not get lewd. I'm in no mood
for a lewd conversation.

937
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:57,710
Come on.

938
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:01,220
I think it'd be a turn-on.
Does he do this all the time ?

939
01:12:04,010 --> 01:12:06,680
Christie,
you're not drinking your wine.

940
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:10,600
Are you telling me you've never
gotten it on with a girl?

941
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:13,810
No. I'm not a lesbian.

942
01:12:13,850 --> 01:12:16,730
Why would you think
I would be into that ?

943
01:12:16,810 --> 01:12:18,980
Well, you went to
Sarah Lawrence for one thing.

944
01:12:19,060 --> 01:12:23,650
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick.
You're making me feel weird.

945
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:30,200
Did you know...

946
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:33,740
that Whitney Houston's
debut LP...

947
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:36,830
called simply
Whitney Houston...

948
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:39,710
had four number-one
singles on it ?

949
01:12:41,170 --> 01:12:43,290
Did you know that,
Christie ?

950
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:46,800
You actually listen
to Whitney Houston ?

951
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:49,670
You own
a Whitney Houston CD ?

952
01:12:51,010 --> 01:12:54,260
More than one ?

953
01:12:54,350 --> 01:12:57,810
It's hard to choose a favorite among
so many great tracks.

954
01:12:59,890 --> 01:13:04,690
But the ‘Greatest Love Of All’
is one of the best, most powerful songs...

955
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:06,900
ever written...

956
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:08,900
about self-preservation...

957
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:11,190
and dignity.

958
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:14,860
It's universal message
crosses all boundaries...

959
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:17,120
and instills one...

960
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:20,830
with the hope
that it's not too late...

961
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:23,250
to better ourselves.

962
01:13:23,290 --> 01:13:26,670
Since, Elizabeth,

963
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:31,710
it's impossible in this world we
live in to empathize with others,

964
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:35,340
we can always empathize
with ourselves.

965
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:39,720
It's an important message.
Crucial, really.

966
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:45,520
And it's beautifully stated
on the album.

967
01:14:55,410 --> 01:14:57,830
- Not the face !

968
01:14:57,910 --> 01:15:01,960
You bitch, not the fucking face,
you piece of bitch trash !

969
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:33,250
I want a firm commitment.

970
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:36,960
I think, um, Evelyn,
that, uh, we've lost touch.

971
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:38,960
Why ? What's wrong ?

972
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:44,470
My need to engage
in homicidal behavior...

973
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:47,340
on a massive scale
cannot be corrected,

974
01:16:47,430 --> 01:16:50,430
but I have no other way
to fulfill my needs.

975
01:16:51,930 --> 01:16:54,850
We need to talk.
Talk about what, Patrick ?

976
01:16:54,930 --> 01:16:56,930
It's over, Evelyn.

977
01:16:57,020 --> 01:16:59,520
It's all over.

978
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:02,900
Touchy, touchy.
I'm sorry I brought up the wedding.

979
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:06,440
Let's just avoid the issue,
all right ? Now, are we having coffee ?

980
01:17:06,530 --> 01:17:11,360
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over, us.
This is no joke.

981
01:17:11,450 --> 01:17:14,320
Uh, I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

982
01:17:14,410 --> 01:17:19,660
But your friends are my friends
and my friends are your friends.

983
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:23,040
I really don't think it would work.
You have a little something--

984
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:28,460
I know that your friends are my friends,
and, uh-- and I've thought about that.

985
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:31,590
You can have 'em.

986
01:17:31,670 --> 01:17:35,130
You're really serious,
aren't you ? Yes, lam.

987
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:42,470
- What about the past ? Our past ?
- We never really shared one.

988
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,600
You're inhuman.
No.

989
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:47,810
I'm in touch with humanity.

990
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:52,320
Evelyn, I'm, uh, sorry.
I just, uh--

991
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,440
You're not terribly
important to me.

992
01:17:54,530 --> 01:17:57,200
Oh, no !

993
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,530
No. No, Patrick.

994
01:17:59,610 --> 01:18:04,160
I know my behavior can be...
erratic sometimes.

995
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:08,620
What do you want me to do ?
What is it that you want ?

996
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:12,040
If you really wanna do something for me,
then stop making this scene right now.

997
01:18:12,130 --> 01:18:15,040
Oh, God, I can't believe this.

998
01:18:15,130 --> 01:18:17,630
I'm leaving. I've assessed the
situation, and I'm going.

999
01:18:17,670 --> 01:18:21,010
Where are you going ?
I'm just leaving.

1000
01:18:21,090 --> 01:18:23,220
But where ?

1001
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:26,550
I have to return
some videotapes.

1002
01:18:57,370 --> 01:18:59,210
Here, kitty, kitty.

1003
01:19:15,510 --> 01:19:17,640
Oh, my God.
What are you doing ?

1004
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:19,730
Stop that.

1005
01:20:01,470 --> 01:20:03,890
Drop the weapon !
Drop it now !

1006
01:20:03,930 --> 01:20:05,970
Get on the ground!
Put your--

1007
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:51,520
Burning the midnight oil,
Mr. Smith ?

1008
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,980
Hey, now don't forget
to sign in.

1009
01:22:23,010 --> 01:22:26,180
Howard, it's Bateman.
Patrick Bateman.

1010
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:29,270
You're my lawyer, so I think you should
know I've killed a lot of people.

1011
01:22:29,350 --> 01:22:32,140
Some escort girls
in an apartment uptown,

1012
01:22:32,230 --> 01:22:35,440
uh, some homeless people,
maybe five or ten,

1013
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:37,900
an N.Y.U. girl I met
in Central Park.

1014
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:40,240
I left her at a parking lot
behind some doughnut shop.

1015
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:43,490
I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend,
with a nail gun.

1016
01:22:43,570 --> 01:22:48,030
And-And-And then some man,
s-s-some old faggot with a dog.

1017
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:50,290
Last week, I, uh--

1018
01:22:50,370 --> 01:22:53,870
I killed another girl
with a chain saw.

1019
01:22:56,670 --> 01:22:59,920
I had to.
She almost got away.

1020
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,920
And--

1021
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:07,130
Someone else there. I can't remember,
maybe a model-- She's dead too.

1022
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:09,760
And, uh, Paul Allen.

1023
01:23:09,850 --> 01:23:13,680
I killed Paul Allen
with an ax in the face.

1024
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:18,190
His body is dissolving
in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen.

1025
01:23:18,270 --> 01:23:22,900
I don't wanna leave anything out here.
I guess I've killed maybe... 20 people.

1026
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:26,070
Maybe 40 !

1027
01:23:26,110 --> 01:23:29,490
I have tapes of a lot of it.

1028
01:23:29,570 --> 01:23:32,200
Some of the girls
have seen the tapes.

1029
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:34,950
I even, um,

1030
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,500
I ate some
of their brains...

1031
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:48,340
and I tried to
cook a little.

1032
01:23:50,710 --> 01:23:53,920
Tonight, I, uh--

1033
01:23:54,010 --> 01:23:57,970
I just had to kill
a lot of people !

1034
01:23:58,010 --> 01:24:00,180
And, um,

1035
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:08,350
I'm not sure I'm gonna
get away with it... this time.

1036
01:24:11,190 --> 01:24:14,230
So, uh-- I mean,

1037
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:17,780
I guess...

1038
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:20,490
I'm a pretty, uh--

1039
01:24:21,570 --> 01:24:24,580
I mean, I guess
I'm a pretty sick guy.

1040
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:27,250
So,

1041
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:31,750
if you get back tomorrow,

1042
01:24:31,830 --> 01:24:34,090
I may show up at Harry's Bar.

1043
01:24:34,170 --> 01:24:37,250
So, you know,

1044
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:39,550
keep your eyes open.

1045
01:24:39,630 --> 01:24:42,720
Okay.

1046
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:48,680
Oh !

1047
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:01,260
Are you my 2:00 ?

1048
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:05,260
No.
Can I help you ?

1049
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:10,510
I'm looking for...
Paul Allen's place.

1050
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:15,440
Doesn't he... live here ?
No, he doesn't.

1051
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:18,440
You sure ?

1052
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:20,860
You saw the ad
in the Times ?

1053
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:23,900
No. Yeah.
I mean, yeah.

1054
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:27,530
ln the Times. There was no ad
in the Times.

1055
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:31,070
I think you should
go now.

1056
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:33,080
But I think--

1057
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:36,910
I wanna know
what happened here.

1058
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,250
Don't make any trouble,
please.

1059
01:27:40,330 --> 01:27:42,580
I suggest you go.

1060
01:27:54,390 --> 01:27:56,300
Don't come back.

1061
01:27:56,390 --> 01:27:58,560
I won't.

1062
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:00,730
Don't worry.

1063
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:31,920
Patrick Bateman's office.

1064
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,710
Jean ? I need help.
Patrick, is that you ?

1065
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:39,340
Jean, I'm not--

1066
01:28:39,430 --> 01:28:43,930
Craig McDermott called. Wants to meet you,
David Van Patten and Tim Bryce at Harry's.

1067
01:28:44,010 --> 01:28:47,890
Oh, God. What did you say,
you dumb bitch ?

1068
01:28:47,970 --> 01:28:51,850
Patrick, I can't hear you.
What am I doing ?

1069
01:28:51,940 --> 01:28:53,900
Where are you, Patrick ?
What's wrong ?

1070
01:28:56,020 --> 01:29:00,740
I don't think I'm gonna make it,Jean,
to the, uh,

1071
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:02,740
office this afternoon.

1072
01:29:02,820 --> 01:29:04,740
Why ?

1073
01:29:04,820 --> 01:29:09,540
Just say no ! What is it, Patrick ?
Are you all right ?

1074
01:29:09,620 --> 01:29:13,790
Stop sounding
so fucking sad.

1075
01:29:13,870 --> 01:29:15,790
Jesus !

1076
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:37,450
That's a table for three. Bateman,
you're looking wild-eyed. Rough day ?

1077
01:30:37,530 --> 01:30:40,450
Hey, look. Bryce is back and
he's drinking mineral water.

1078
01:30:40,530 --> 01:30:43,620
He's a changed man, except for he still
can't a reservation to save his life.

1079
01:30:43,700 --> 01:30:45,870
Why don't you just try
150 Wooster?

1080
01:30:45,950 --> 01:30:49,460
I'm not going anywhere
unless we have a reservation.

1081
01:30:49,540 --> 01:30:53,340
Le Cirque, Flamingo East, OysterBar.
Come on, faggots. Let's get a ‘res.’

1082
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:57,170
Keep your shirt on.
Maybe lose the suspenders.

1083
01:30:57,260 --> 01:30:59,260
Need a reservation
for 8:30.

1084
01:30:59,340 --> 01:31:01,880
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Right back.

1085
01:31:01,970 --> 01:31:04,390
10:00 would not be
any good. No.

1086
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:07,810
Just fucking call them. Give me the phone.
I'll do it. I'll call you back.

1087
01:31:07,850 --> 01:31:11,270
Face it. The Japanese will own most
of this country by the end of the '90s.

1088
01:31:11,310 --> 01:31:14,310
Shut up, Carnes.
They will not.

1089
01:31:15,770 --> 01:31:19,440
So, uh, Harold,
did you get my message ?

1090
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:23,740
Jesus, yes. That was hilarious.
That was you, wasn't it ?

1091
01:31:23,820 --> 01:31:27,570
Yeah, naturally. Bateman killing Allen
and the escort girls.

1092
01:31:27,660 --> 01:31:29,580
That's fabulous. That's rich.
What exactly do you mean ?

1093
01:31:29,660 --> 01:31:34,080
The message you left. By the way, Davis,
how's Cynthia ? You're still seeing her, right ?

1094
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:36,250
W-Wait, Harold.
What do you mean ?

1095
01:31:36,330 --> 01:31:39,920
Excuse me. Nothing.
It's good to see you.

1096
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,540
Is that Edward Towers ?

1097
01:31:42,630 --> 01:31:44,550
Carnes, wait. Uh--

1098
01:31:44,630 --> 01:31:50,390
Davis, I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone.
Your joke was amusing.

1099
01:31:50,470 --> 01:31:54,390
But come on, man.
You had one fatal flaw:

1100
01:31:54,470 --> 01:31:56,560
Bateman is such a dork.

1101
01:31:56,640 --> 01:32:00,270
Such a boring,
spineless lightweight.

1102
01:32:00,350 --> 01:32:04,190
Now, if you said Bryce or Mc Dermott.
Otherwise, it was amusing.

1103
01:32:04,270 --> 01:32:06,860
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I really must be going.

1104
01:32:06,940 --> 01:32:10,440
Wait. Uh-- Stop.

1105
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:14,320
I did it, Carnes.

1106
01:32:14,410 --> 01:32:16,370
I killed him.

1107
01:32:16,410 --> 01:32:18,990
I'm Patrick Bateman.

1108
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:24,460
I chopped Allen's
fucking head off.

1109
01:32:25,710 --> 01:32:30,710
The whole message
I left on your machine was true.

1110
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:33,630
Excuse me.
I really must be going now.

1111
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:36,880
No. No, listen.

1112
01:32:36,970 --> 01:32:39,470
Don't you know who I am ?

1113
01:32:39,550 --> 01:32:42,310
I'm not Davis.
I'm Patrick Bateman.

1114
01:32:45,020 --> 01:32:48,270
We talk on the phone
all the time.

1115
01:32:48,310 --> 01:32:50,940
Don't you recognize me ?

1116
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:55,150
You're my lawyer.

1117
01:32:55,230 --> 01:32:59,820
Now, Carnes, listen.

1118
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:02,160
Listen very, very carefully.

1119
01:33:05,870 --> 01:33:09,200
I killed Paul Allen,

1120
01:33:09,290 --> 01:33:11,290
and I liked it.

1121
01:33:11,330 --> 01:33:15,170
I can't make myself
any clearer.

1122
01:33:15,210 --> 01:33:19,340
But that's simply not possible.
And I don't find this funny anymore.

1123
01:33:19,420 --> 01:33:22,970
It never was supposed to be.
Why isn't it possible ?

1124
01:33:23,010 --> 01:33:27,300
It's just not.
Why not, you stupid bastard ?

1125
01:33:27,350 --> 01:33:29,640
Because I had dinner
with Paul Allen...

1126
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:32,270
twice in London
just ten days ago.

1127
01:33:32,350 --> 01:33:34,430
No, you...

1128
01:33:37,190 --> 01:33:40,020
didn't.
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1129
01:34:21,230 --> 01:34:23,560
We've seen the results
of that mistrust...

1130
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:27,150
in the form of lies,
provisions in the states.

1131
01:34:27,230 --> 01:34:31,690
We need to find a way to cooperate while
realizing foreign policy...

1132
01:34:31,730 --> 01:34:34,150
can't be run
by committee.

1133
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:36,700
And I believe there's now
the growing sense...

1134
01:34:36,780 --> 01:34:40,700
that we can accomplish more
by cooperating.

1135
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:44,710
And in the end, this maybe the eventual
blessing in disguise...

1136
01:34:44,790 --> 01:34:46,790
to come out of
the Iran-Contra mess.

1137
01:34:46,870 --> 01:34:50,500
How can he lie like that ?

1138
01:34:50,580 --> 01:34:52,550
How can he pull that shit ?
What shit ?

1139
01:34:52,590 --> 01:34:54,710
Now, where do we have
reservations at ?

1140
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:57,760
I'm not really hungry, but I'd like
to have reservations someplace.

1141
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:00,760
How can you be so fucking,

1142
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:03,350
I don't know,
cool about it ?

1143
01:35:03,430 --> 01:35:06,890
Some guys arejust
born cool, I guess.

1144
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:13,770
Bateman ?

1145
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:19,110
- What are you so fucking zany about ?
- I'm just a happy camper.

1146
01:35:19,190 --> 01:35:21,650
Rockin' and a rollin' !

1147
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:23,780
Oh, brother, look.

1148
01:35:23,860 --> 01:35:28,910
He presents himself as this harmless
old codger, but inside--

1149
01:35:28,950 --> 01:35:31,580
but inside--

1150
01:35:31,660 --> 01:35:34,580
But inside doesn't matter.

1151
01:35:34,620 --> 01:35:38,960
Inside ? Believe or not, Bryce,
we're actually listening to you.

1152
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:41,630
Come on, Bateman.
What do you think ?

1153
01:35:44,550 --> 01:35:48,840
- Whatever.
- Whose moronic idea was it to order dry beers ?

1154
01:35:48,930 --> 01:35:50,930
I need a scotch.

1155
01:36:07,110 --> 01:36:10,150
There are no more barriers
to cross.

1156
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:14,080
All I have in common with the
uncontrollable and the insane,

1157
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:17,500
the vicious and the evil,
all the mayhem I have caused...

1158
01:36:17,540 --> 01:36:19,620
and my utter indifference
toward it,

1159
01:36:19,700 --> 01:36:22,290
I have now surpassed.

1160
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:27,880
My pain is constant and sharp...

1161
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:31,590
and I do not hope
for a better world for anyone.

1162
01:36:31,670 --> 01:36:36,180
In fact, I want my pain
to be inflicted on others.

1163
01:36:36,260 --> 01:36:38,850
I want no one to escape.

1164
01:36:39,970 --> 01:36:42,850
But even after admitting this,

1165
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:45,100
there is no catharsis.

1166
01:36:45,190 --> 01:36:47,940
My punishment continues
to elude me...

1167
01:36:48,020 --> 01:36:51,230
and I gain no deeper knowledge
of myself.

1168
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:55,070
No new knowledge can be
extracted from my telling.

1169
01:36:55,150 --> 01:36:59,320
This confession
has meant... nothing."
